##############MVC FUNDAMENTALS##################################

MVC, separation between presentation layer and applicaton layer and back end.

Model - can communicate with tables in app. (User, Post, Article)
View - what the user sees, (home.html.erb, new.html.erb , my_portfolio.html.erb)
Controller - brains behind application (users_controller, posts_controller, articles_controller)

MVC - Model, View, Controller

General flow of Rails application:

-> Request made at browser

-> Request received at router of rails application

-> Request routed to appropriate action in a controller

-> Controller#action either renders a view template or communicates with model

-> Model communicates with database

-> Model sends back information to controller

-> Controller renders view
